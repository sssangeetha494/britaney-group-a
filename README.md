Forget-Me-Not

1 – Overview

The purpose of this application is to give the user a single placeholder that holds and tracks all of their warranties, accounts with recurring payments, and similar subscriptions. The user will be able to upload documents and keep them organized so that nothing falls through the cracks. The application will notify the user before the end date or renewal date of their various subscriptions.

2 – Features

Users can create and authenticate accounts using Google Sign-In (Add to part 4).
Users can create, read, edit, and delete receipts and their details.
Users can upload pictures of their documents.
Users can write notes for the products.
User form has categories for products.
Warranties/ Subscription Payments
AAA
Home Insurance
Health Insurance
SaaS

Apple Music
Google Drive Extended Storage

Users can enter their email to receive notifications before the expiration date.
The future enhancement for this app would be to provide a place to save the scanned documents of Drivers' License, Insurance cards, Passports and other documents that need a higher level of security.

Java
JavaScript

4 – What You’ll Have to Learn

We’ll have to learn more about authentication. We’ll also have to learn more about how to collaborate with each other throughout the course of this project, because we didn’t have the opportunity to collaborate during the independent track of this project. We’ll also have to learn how to allow the user to sign in with Google.
